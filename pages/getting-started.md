## Mission
We want the site to feel like a fast, modern sports desk—clean mint accents, generous whitespace, and quick reads that work on phones and desktops.

## What changed
- **Navigation reset.** Primary tabs now mirror the sports experience (Teams, Players, Games, Insights) instead of theme demos.
- **Data scaffolding.** `_data/teams.yml` holds league-friendly records while you finalize your API.
- **Dynamic hooks.** The Games page ships with a client-side fetch demo pointed at `assets/data/game-snapshots.json`.

## Your inputs
Share your preferred leagues, API choices, and any brand constraints so we can tune the palette and typography closer to [mintboxx.com](http://www.mintboxx.com/).
